// What kind of value we can assign to a variable
// Basically in JS we have two categories of type.
// 1. Primitive or Value Type
// 2. Reference Type


//? What kind of value we can assign to a variable?
//! Primitive or Value Type
// * Literal A literal is "any notation for representing a value within source code" 
let name = 'Zohaib'     // String Literal "" or ''
let age = 22            // Number Literal
let isApproved = false  // Boolean Literal
// if we don't initialize by default its value is undefined
// But we can also explicitly set this to undefined
let firstName = undefined;
// We use null in a situation where we want to explicitly clear the value of a variable
let selectedColor = null;


//? What is Dynamic Type of language?
