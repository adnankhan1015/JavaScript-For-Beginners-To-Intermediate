// ! Assignment Operator
// * We are using the simple assignment operator to assign a value.
let x = 10;

// x++ = x = x + 1

console.log(x *= 5)
console.log(x = x + 5)
// ! Both the console are equal
// console.log(x)

// ! All the ARITHMETIC Operator have the same combination with assignment Operator
